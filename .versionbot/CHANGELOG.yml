- commits:
    - body: >-
        Fixes https://github.com/balena-io-library/base-images/issues/641.

        Python should be compiled with libbluetooth, otherwise it cannot access

        the AF_BLUETOOTH socket. This feature is in the official images (see https://github.com/docker-library/python/pull/445) so we should support it too.

    - subject: Update build script to support Python v3.7.0 and higher
- commits:
    - body: >-
        There is a breaking change, since Python v3.7.0, OpenSSL lower than
        v1.0.2 will no longer be supported. It affects Debian Jessie and Ubuntu
        14.04 and older releases.

        So this PR will update the build script to support this change
